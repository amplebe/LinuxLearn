# LinuxLearn
## Day 1
-
- First linux command - ls. This is the list command. It allows us... list the content of the directory.
'''ls --color=no'''
So, this leads us to the first output, the colorized list of content. In order to have it, we need to run
'''ls --color=yes'''
or, alternatively for now
'''ls --color=auto .'''
