## Day 1
> ### ls Command
- First linux command is ``` ls ```. This is the list command. It allows us... **list the content** of the directory.
- ``` ls --color=no ```
- So, this leads us to the first output, the **colorized list of content.** In order to have it, we need to run
``` ls --color=yes ```
- or, alternatively for now
``` ls --color=auto ```
