> ### ls Command
- First linux command is ``` ls ```. This is the list command. It allows us to **list the content** of the directory.
- ``` ls --color=no ```
- So, this leads us to the first output, the **colorized list of content.** In order to have it, we need to run
``` ls --color=yes ```
- or, alternatively for now
``` ls --color=auto ```
to clear the screen  `clear`

> #### Get more details with ls Command
- What we pass after the command `-` these are **arguments**. Not switches, parameters, etc.
- `ls -l` - to get More details in list command
- `l` means long listing format.
- `-` indicates that we will pass arguments. We have two ways here
	1. `-` one dash informs the system that we will pass one letter argument, like 'l'
	2. `--` two dashes means that argument will contain more than one letter. Most commonly it will be an english word.
